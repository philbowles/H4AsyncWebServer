# What does it do?

On its own, not a lot and to change that you need to be a reasonable C++ programmer. It is designed as an abstract base class and both [PangolinMQTT](https://github.com/philbowles/PangolinMQTT) and [ArmadilloHTTP](https://github.com/philbowles/ArmadilloHTTP) use it as their core Async TCP driver. So if you want to use either of those, (or [H4/Plugins](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins) which sits on top of them both) you will need it anyway, even if you are not going to write your own sub-class.

It's useful if you want to write your own Async protocol handler, as 90% of the hard bits have already been done for you. For example both the bugs and differences in the traditional ESPAsyncTCP (for ESP8266) and AsyncTCP (for ESP32) have been ironed out, so that there is a single common interface for all your Async TCP apps from now on. The whole process is reduced to:

* set up server URL
* set up RX function to receive data
* connect to server
* send some data

Where permitted by the calling library, TLS is available merely by using "https" in the server URL rather than "http". Be aware that TLS implementation is "cheap and cheerful" and only available on ESP8266. It will not connect with servers requiring advanced features such as client certificates, military-grade cipher suites etc.

One of the main benefits that that the pre-requisite forked versions of the Async Libraries ( [Forked AsyncTCP](https://github.com/philbowles/AsyncTCP-master) and [Forked ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/philbowles/ESPAsyncTCP-master) ) bring is *huge** packet fragmentation on transmit (TX), and reassembly of *huge** packets on receive (RX). 

It also fixes at least two fatal bugs in ESPAsyncTCP (for ESP8266) which cause significant issues when trying to implement robust apps on top of that library and adds missing features to AsyncTCP (for ESP32). It still exposes the entire "old-style" API from the broken original libraries, to ease porting of any exisiting code you may have. Having said that, once you see how easy it is to use, you will almost certainly dispense with any old-style calls.

*By "huge" we mean any packet that is larger than the total LwIP buffer space. For example on ESP8266, if you compile with the "Low Memory" option this will be 1072 bytes or 2920 with the "Higher Bandwith" options (at core 2.7.4)

![lwip](assets/lwip.jpg)

LwIP allows multiple buffers so what you see in the figures above is 1072=2x536 and 2920=2x1460. The important point here is that *all* of the values 536, 1460 (the individual LwIP buffer size) and 2 (the number of buffers) are implementation-dependent and *could* change in the future, so "hardcoding" any of them into your own app would be a **bad idea** as it could cause problems in the future or prevent you code running on newer / different machines.

H4AsyncClient solves that problem by allowing data up to 1/2 of the free heap to be sent / received, irrespective of those LwIP "magic numbers". As an example, here it is running "underneath" [PangolinMQTT](https://github.com/philbowles/PangolinMQTT) on an ESP8266 and allowing that lib to send and receive a 22kb+(!) MQTT packet

![twentytwo](assets/twentytwo.jpg)

On ESP32 this can grow to over 50kb

## Worth 1000 words:

Other than the ESPAsyncTCP/AsynTCP API which is exposed for compatibility should you need it (you won't!), the main H4AsyncClient API is:

```cpp
// callbacks
void    onTCPconnect(H4AT_cbConnect callback);
void    onTCPdisconnect(H4AT_cbDisconnect callback);
void    onTCPerror(H4AT_cbError callback);
void    onTCPpoll(H4AT_cbPoll callback);
// setup / connect / disconnect
void    TCPurl(const char* url,const uint8_t* fingerprint=nullptr);
void    TCPconnect();
void    TCPdisconnect(bool force = false);
// send / receive
void    rx(H4AT_FN_RXDATA f);
void    TX(const uint8_t* d,size_t len,bool copy=true);
```

Unless you need very special handling, most practical use cases boil down to:

* define rx function
* set URL, connect
* tx data

# API

Since H4AsyncClient must be inherited from, all of the following methods are `protected`

The only public methods are the default constructor and the `dump` function (if H4AT_DEBUG is set in H4AT_config.h)

```cpp
void    _parseURL(const std::string& url);// insiders shortcut
void    onTCPconnect(H4AT_cbConnect callback); // <void(void)>
void    onTCPdisconnect(H4AT_cbDisconnect callback); // <void(int8_t)> -ve values arise in TCP, +ve values generated by H4AsyncClient
void    onTCPerror(H4AT_cbError callback); // <void(int e,int info)> see above. Info gives more details 
void    onTCPpoll(H4AT_cbPoll callback); // <void(void)>
void    rx(H4AT_FN_RXDATA f); // all received data comes here: <void(const uint8_t*,size_t)>;
void    TCPconnect(); // does what it says on the tin...
void    TCPdisconnect(bool force = false); // ...as does this
void    TCPurl(const char* url,const uint8_t* fingerprint=nullptr); // see below
void    TX(mbx m); // internal use only
void    TX(const uint8_t* d,size_t len,bool copy=true); // send data. Leave the default to true.

```

[Example sketch](examples/inherit/inherit.ino)

## URL defintion

The url must be specified in the following general form. The extended path and query portions are optional, as is the port. If the port is omitted it will default to 80 for URLs starting `http` and 443 for those starting `https`

`http://hostname:port/path/to/resource?a=b&c=d"`

or

`https://hostname:port/path/to/resource?a=b&c=d"`

The `hostname` portion my be specified as a "dotted quad" IP address e.g. "172.103.22.14" or a publicly resolvable DNS name e.g. `somehost.co.uk`

ESP8266 targets will happily resolve `.local` names. See "Known Issues" re ESP32

### Valid examples

* `http://192.168.1.15` // defaults to port 80
* `https://myremotehost.com/api?userid=123456` // default to port 443
* `https://mosquitto.local:8883` // .local only works on ESP8266 at the moment
* `http://insecure.remote.ru:12345/long/resource/path/?data=123&moredata=456`

### Using TLS

TLS is only currently only available on ESP8266 targets. The first step to using TLS is to edit the [`async_config.h`](https://github.com/philbowles/ESPAsyncTCP-master/blob/master/src/async_config.h) file in [Forked AsyncTCP](https://github.com/philbowles/AsyncTCP-master/scr) and change `#define ASYNC_TCP_SSL_ENABLED 0` to `#define ASYNC_TCP_SSL_ENABLED 1`

Note that this will significantly increase the size of the compiled app. Unless you absolutely need it, do not compile in TLS!

Note also that the version of TLS that ships with ESPAsyncTCP is very weak and there are many sites that will refuse to connect as they require stronger ciphers or client certificates etc.

![tls](assets/common/tls.jpg)
### TODO

* Add `@username:password` basic auth scheme for e.g. [ArmadilloHTTP](https://github.com/philbowles/ArmadilloHTTP)


---

# Known Issues

* ESP32 version cannot resolve `.local` addresses so you will need to specify the IP address
* TLS very limited: only sites with very low requirements will allow connection
* Some sites that send chunked-encoding responses also send dditonal packets - this confuses the rebuiulding mechanism. 
  A better way needs to be found and will be fixed in a future release

# History / Origin

H4AsyncClient is in essence the blue portion of the following diagram, chopped out of [PangolinMQTT](https://github.com/philbowles/PangolinMQTT) so as a "core concept" it has been working well for quite a while.

In that role it allowed for huge payloads (up to 1/2 the available Free Heap) to be sent and received over MQTT. It fragments the outgoing packets into message blocks small enough to fit whatever LwIP buffers your implementation has configured (without you having to worry or even know what they are) and acts a flow-control manager to synchronise the real-time to-ing, fro-ing and ACK-ing of Asynchronous TCP in the background. It does the reverse for huge incoming messages, which can only arrive - by definition - one LwIP buffer-full at a time. It then reassembles all the fragments into one huge packet and passes it to the MQTT protocol analyser.

No other library known to the author for ESP8266 / ESP32 can do this for MQTT and it does it seamlessly over TLS for HTTPS(ESP8266 only) or unencrypted HTTP (ESP8266 and ESP32). From the user's point-of-view you just "send a large packet" or "receive a large packet" - *which is the way it should be!*

It is not much of a leap to realise that the same functionality is ideal for asynchronous retrieval of web resources / APIs / REST services over HTTP/S. Yes, there are many examples of "reaching out" to remote servers e.g. Blynk or Thingspeak etc, but the author knows of none that are fully asynchronous ***and*** that can safely and robustly handle 20-30kb pages as can [ArmadilloHTTP](https://github.com/philbowles/ArmadilloHTTP) - which you could visualise as the diagram below with "MQTT" crossed out and "HTTP" written in in crayon)

# Issues

## If you want a *quick* resolution, please follow these rules:

1. As with all H4 and H4Plugins libraries, please make sure you have read *all* the relevant documentation relating to the issue and watched any videos on the [Youtube channel (instructional videos)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYi-Ko76_3p9hBUtleZRY6g). Please also subscribe to the channel for notifications of news and updates.

2. If you still think there is a problem, then join the [Facebook H4  Support / Discussion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/444344099599131/) group and report the issue briefly there. This is because I visit the group every day, whereas I do not have time to visit 11 github repos every day. Furthermore, it alerts other users to potential problems and allows an initial assessment. 

3. If there is a genuine issue then you will be referred to [Raising H4/H4Plugins issues](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins/blob/master/docs/issues.md) after which you are advised to create a full github issue report.

4. Failing to make an initial report in the [Facebook H4  Support / Discussion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/444344099599131/) group and simply starting with a github issue, or failing to include all of the information required in [Raising H4/H4Plugins issues](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins/blob/master/docs/issues.md) is likely to result in a ***long*** delay before it gets picked up.
